A week ago my friend Pablo and me released the very first episode of Code && Beyond.
None of us had any experience in podcasting or ever worked with voice and audio.
But we did that!

<!--more-->

## Inspiration

Almost every weekend for the last couple of years Pablo and I meet remotely to talk about all sorts of things.
We discuss software, productivity, creativity, books and podcasts, and many other topics.
Recently I suggested an idea to record our discussions and release them as a podcast because I was heavily inspired by [Raabe & Kampf podcast][1].
Pablo was kind enough and agreed to participate in this crazy adventure.

## Naming

Every good project needs a name, and naming things is one of [the hardest problems][2] to solve.
Options like "Life in development" or "Code and whatnot" were discarded in favor of short and beautiful "Code && Beyond" (`AND` operator is supposed to hint at software development :wink:).

## Learning

As none of us had any idea how to make a podcast, it was necessary to learn at least the basics of the process.
After watching lots of videos on YouTube and reading many pages on the internet, I could highly recommend the following resources for anyone who aspires to become a podcaster:

* [How to Make a Podcast: Plan, Record, and Launch with Success][3].
  A free online class from Anchor (duration ~1h).
  John Lagomarsino walks through each step of the podcasting process, from honing your initial idea to launch and promotion.
* [I should start a podcast][4].
  A podcast from Anchor about how to start a podcast.
  It has only 8 short episodes (~15 minutes each).
* [How to start a podcast][5].
  One page that explains all the basics.
* [Podcasting How-To][6] by Dan Benjamin.
  A set of short videos on YouTube to learn microphone techniques, compression, and more.
* [Buzzsprout â€” Learn How to Podcast][7] a great resource on YouTube for podcasting beginners.

Kudos to everyone who makes educational resources. You rock!

## Final result

The podcast is online and available already on [Spotify][8], [Apple Podcasts][9], [Google Podcasts][10], and other platforms.

Give it a listen at [codeandbeyond.rocks][11].
Any feedback is highly appreciated.

## Summary

It took some time to learn the basics, record, and mix the first episode, but it was a lot of fun.
If you are thinking to start a podcast, I can recommend pursuing this idea.
You should try not because of possible opportunity to earn money or fame, but just because it's fun and will make you happy.

Keep trying new things! :smile:
