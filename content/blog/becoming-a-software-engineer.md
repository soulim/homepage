Recently I realized that a professional career started for me twenty years ago.
However a journey of becoming a software engineer begins much earlier, and
the first sparkle of interest wasn't created by a computer itself.

The story starts for me with a book. When I was about 9 years old, parents
bought me a book about a boy who got inside of a computer. He helped people
living there to catch a computer virus and found many friends there. It was an
amazing adventure for the boy and me. The book wasn't an ordinary one.
It had two parts: one is the story itself, and another one is a glossary with
all "computer terms" mentioned in the story. The glossary wasn't that boring
list of terms with explanations either. It was a comic! Every term there was as a short
story in a comic style.

The book became something special for me. I was going through the glossary part
over and over again, enjoying every detail. Seeing that, parents got me an
extension to the book. It was a computer encyclopedia for kids. Basically it was
the glossary part extended with other terms (comics!), math puzzles, and little
games.

The encyclopedia contained also instructions on how to build a computer model
using paper and clue. After a couple days of deliberate work, my first computer was
ready! I was playing video games on it using one of the best tools ever -
imagination :smile:

As every kid I was thinking to become an astronaut who explores the space, or a
doctor who helps people, or an adventurer who travels around the world, or lots of
other things, but that was *before* the book. The book showed me an amazing world,
and I decided to become a part of it. That was 30 years ago and I *never* regreted
that choice. Every single day I truly enjoy being a software engineer who
creates things, helps people, uses the imagination to solve problems, and
explores the world he discovered many years ago.

## Hello Ruby

Of course, books that inspired me aren't published anymore, but if you know a
kid who is looking for ways to explore the world of computers, I can highly
recommend ["Hello Ruby"](https://www.helloruby.com/) created by amazing Linda
Liukas. Together with my son Tim we read two of them already, and that reminded
me a lot my childhood experience with the books that changed my life.

Have a wonderful day and enjoy everything you do! :wink:

*P.S.: The first time when I got a chance to touch and work with a real computer
was six years after parents gave the book. But that's another story already. Stay
tuned to listen to it soon.*
