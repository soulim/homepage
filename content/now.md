As current situation with COVID-19 doesn't provide many chances to travel,
I'm trying to explore Berlin and surroundings. [komoot](https://www.komoot.com/)
helps to discover new places and interesting routes.

Projects I'm working on:

  * A tool that connects my handwritten notes with the internet.
  * A tool with an exciting name *"holodeck"*.

*This is a "now page" which lists the work and other priorities that I'm focusing on now. It's inspired by an idea from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now).*
