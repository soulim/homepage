Bundler, a Ruby package manager, provides two options to list gems in the bundle.

<!--more-->

- [`bundle show`](https://bundler.io/v2.5/man/bundle-show.1.html)
- [`bundle list`](https://bundler.io/v2.5/man/bundle-list.1.html)

If no options provided, both commands print a list of gems and their versions.
As well as they output the list of paths of all gems, when executed with the `--paths` option.

The difference between two commands becomes visible when other options are provided.

- `bundle list` can print the list with additional group fileters applied.
- `bundle show` is suitable to get the path of only one gem in the bundle.
