As current situation with COVID-19 doesn't provide many chances to travel,
I'm trying to explore Berlin and surroundings. [komoot](https://www.komoot.com/)
helps to discover new places and interesting routes.

Projects I'm working on:

  * A tool that connects my handwritten notes with the internet.
  * A tool with an exciting name *"holodeck"*.
  * [**Code && Beyond**](https://codeandbeyond.rocks/) a (semi)weekly podcast
    with my friend Pablo and me, two software engineers with more than 35 years of
    professional experience combined. We talk about creativity, productivity,
    problem solving, tools, culture, and anything beyond, but still related to
    the daily life of a software developer.

*This is a "now page" which lists the work and other priorities that I'm focusing on now. It's inspired by an idea from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now).*
