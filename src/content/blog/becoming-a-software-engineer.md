Recently I realized that a professional career started for me twenty years ago.
However the journey of becoming a software engineer begins much earlier, and
the first sparkle of interest wasn't created by a computer itself.

The story starts for me with a book.

When I was about 9 years old, my parents bought me a book[^1] about a boy who
got inside of a computer. The boy helped people living there to catch a computer
virus and found many friends there. It was an amazing adventure for the little
boy and me. The book wasn't an ordinary one. It had two parts: one is the story
itself, and another one is a glossary with all "computer terms" mentioned in the
story. The glossary wasn't that boring list of terms with explanations either.
It was a comic! Every term there was a short story in a comic style.

The book became something special for me. I was going through the glossary part
over and over again, enjoying every detail. Seeing that, my parents got me an
extension to the book. It was a computer encyclopedia for kids. Basically, it
was the glossary part extended with other terms (comics!), math puzzles, and
little games.

The encyclopedia contained also instructions on how to build a computer model
using paper and clues [^2]. After a couple days of deliberate work, my first
computer was ready! I was playing video games on it using one of the best tools
ever - imagination :smile:

Like every kid, I was thinking to become an astronaut who explores space, or a
doctor who helps people, or an adventurer who travels around the world, or lots
of other things, but that was *before* the book. The book showed me an amazing
world, and I decided to become a part of it. That was 30 years ago and I *never*
regretted that choice. Every single day I truly enjoy being a software engineer
who creates things, helps people, uses his imagination to solve problems, and
explores the world he discovered many years ago.


## Hello Ruby

Of course, these books that inspired me aren't published anymore. However if you
know a kid who is looking for ways to explore the world of computers, I can
highly recommend ["Hello Ruby"](https://www.helloruby.com/) created by amazing
Linda Liukas. Together with my son Tim we read two of them already, and that
reminded me a lot of my childhood experience with the books that changed my
life years ago.

Have a wonderful day! :wink:

[^1]: The book is written in Russian, and unfortunately I cannot find a link on
  its description in English.

[^2]: The first time when I got a chance to touch and work with a *real* the
  computer was six years after my parents gave me the book. But that's another
  story already. Stay tuned to listen to it soon.
